+++ General

For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag ("{{?>}}") is never permitted. It is not required by PHP. Not including it prevents trailing whitespace from being accidentally injected into the output.

IMPORTANT: Inclusion of arbitrary binary data as permitted by {{__HALT_COMPILER()}} is prohibited from any Doctrine framework PHP file or files derived from them. Use of this feature is only permitted for special installation scripts. 


+++ Indentation

Use an indent of 4 spaces, with no tabs.


+++ Maximum line length

The target line length is 80 characters, i.e. developers should aim keep code as close to the 80-column boundary as is practical. However, longer lines are acceptable. The maximum length of any line of PHP code is 120 characters. 


+++ Line termination

* Line termination is the standard way for Unix text files. Lines must end only with a linefeed (LF). Linefeeds are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.
* Do not use carriage returns (CR) like Macintosh computers (0x0D).
* Do not use the carriage return/linefeed combination (CRLF) as Windows computers (0x0D, 0x0A).
