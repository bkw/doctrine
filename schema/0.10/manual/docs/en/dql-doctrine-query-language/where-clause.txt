Syntax:

<code type="sql">
WHERE <where_condition>
</code>

* The {{WHERE}} clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions that the records must satisfy to be selected.
* {{where_condition}} is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected.
* The statement selects all rows if there is no {{WHERE}} clause.
* When narrowing results with aggregate function values {{HAVING}} clause should be used instead of {{WHERE}} clause
