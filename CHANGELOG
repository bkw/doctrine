    * [r4087] Fixed #749.
    * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

    * [r4090] Fixes #801
    * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

    * [r4087] Fixed #749.
    * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

0.9.1
-----
    * [r3529] Fixed count bug in Doctrine_Pager that was wrong counting the total of results found. Added 3 new methods: Doctrine_Pager::getExecuted (checks if the Pager was already executed), Doctrine_Pager_Layout::execute (handy access to execute Pager query without having to access Doctrine_Pager instance) and Doctrine_Pager_Layout::processPage (processes the template of a given page and returns the parsed string)
