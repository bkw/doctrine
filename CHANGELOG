     * [r4488] Fixes 1116. Actually it is a PHP bug that was only solved in 6 march 2008. So only possible release to have this fixed is using PHP 5.2.6. Please refer to
	  http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40417 for more explanation. I updated the test case to be sure we are correctly passing things to MySQL. Updated Query and QueryAbstract to use getParams as
	  they should. Also, getParams only displays the correct number of params after preQuery event. SoftDelete binds new values only after processing DQL (which is done calling getSql()), so
	  getParams only has the right values after it.

    * [r4087] Fixed #749.
    * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

    * [r4087] Fixed #749.
    * [r4089] Fixed #838. After reviewing the testcase, i've come to the conclusion that the desired use is invalid because it would basically allow having 2 root nodes in the tree (even if its temporarily) and would therefore allow an invalid state / corrupt tree. I modified the testcase to reflect how it *could* be done, but that only works well when the old root does not yet have any children. There are several solutions though: You can use a multi-root setup, in which case the desired action would be absolutely lega. Or you can use a single-root tree, but have the real root as a dummy root that never changes and have a second node as the only child which is your root then. And there may be even more options, depending on your particular use-case.

0.9.1
-----
    * [r3529] Fixed count bug in Doctrine_Pager that was wrong counting the total of results found. Added 3 new methods: Doctrine_Pager::getExecuted (checks if the Pager was already executed), Doctrine_Pager_Layout::execute (handy access to execute Pager query without having to access Doctrine_Pager instance) and Doctrine_Pager_Layout::processPage (processes the template of a given page and returns the parsed string)
    * [r3534] backporting whereNotIn from trunk
    * [r3536] Added a fix in toArray method to prevent mapped Doctrine_Record values to be displayed fully
    * [r3538] Added different counter query support for Doctrine_Pager. Now it can use 2 different queries to paginate items. Added 4 new methods: setCountQuery, getCountQuery, setCountQueryParams and getCountQueryParams. If not defined a counter Doctrine_Query, the collector one is used. If no params were defined to be used in counter query, the ones passed by execute method are used
    * [r3539] Fixed wrong call to _setExecuted in Pager
    * [r3540] Fixed _adjustOffset in order to get it working after previous change in Pager
    * [r3541] setting default templatse for the payer layout
    * [r3542] Removed initial definition of setSelectedTemplate in Doctrine_Pager_layout in all branches. If no selected template is defined, the default assigned template is used. This prevent possible issue where the user defines default but not selected template (will use the defined one in class, what is wrong)
    * [r3546] Fixed a bug where the hydration mode HYDRATE_NONE was not recognized when set through setHydrationMode
    * [r3550] #740: fixed issue with hydrate when given an array containing null values. Previously, if you loaded a record from the database, then something changed that record in the database, and you loaded the same record again in the same script, any values that had been changed to null in the database would not be updated in the reloaded object.
    * [r3554] Added Doctrine::HYDRATE_NONE example to "Fetch Only What You Need" subchapter of the "Improving performanc" chapter.

    * [r3680] Merged changeset #3579 into 0.9 and 0.10 branches. This change does not break any test case, but it changes the behavior of Sluggable in both branches. TODO is to test this change in real life.
    * [r3681] Merged changeset #3578 into 0.9 and 0.10 branches

    * [r3769] convertBoolean method was not working correctly for Pgsql, when integer value 0|1 was used as value for boolean type columns instead of true|false.
