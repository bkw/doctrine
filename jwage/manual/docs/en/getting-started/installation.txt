The installation of doctrine is very easy. Just get the latest revision of
Doctrine from http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk. 

You need a SVN (Subversion) client for downloading Doctrine.

In order to check out Doctrine in the current directory using the **svn** command line tool use the following code: 

<code type="bash">
svn co http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk . 
</code>

If you do not have a SVN client, chose one from the list below. Find the
**Checkout** option and enter http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk in the **path** or **repository url** parameter. There is no need for a username or password to check out Doctrine.
