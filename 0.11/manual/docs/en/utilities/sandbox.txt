+++ Installation

You can install the sandbox by downloading the special sandbox package from http://www.phpdoctrine.org/download or you can 
install it via svn below.

<code>
svn co http://www.phpdoctrine.org/svn/branches/0.10 doctrine
cd doctrine/tools/sandbox
chmod 0777 doctrine

./doctrine
</code>

The above steps should give you a functioning sandbox. Execute the ./doctrine command without specifying a task will show 
you an index of all the available cli tasks in Doctrine.
