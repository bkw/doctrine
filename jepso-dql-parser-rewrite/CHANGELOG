* r3183: NestedSet: 'level' column renamed to 'lvl' because LEVEL is an oracle keyword.
         In order to upgrade existing trees you need to rename the level column to lvl
         in your databases. This does not affect your code because the NestedSet now uses
         a column alias (lvl as level). So your code still refers to the 'level' field.
* r3048: Doctrine::exportSchema() replaced by Doctrine::createTablesFromModels()
* r3048: Doctrine::exportSql() replaced by Doctrine::generateSqlFromModels()
* r3048: Doctrine::importSchema() replaced by Doctrine::generateModelsFromDb()
* r3048: loadAll() loadAllRuntimeClasses() removed
