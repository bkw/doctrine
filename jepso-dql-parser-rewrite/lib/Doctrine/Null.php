/**
 * Null class representing a null value that has been fetched from
 * the database or a fetched, empty association. This is for internal use only.
 * User code should never deal with this null object.
 * 
 * Semantics are as follows:
 * 
 * Regular PHP null : Value is undefined. When a field with that value is accessed
 *                    and lazy loading is used the database is queried.
 * 
 * Null object: Null valued of a field or empty association that has already been loaded.
 *              On access, the database is not queried.
