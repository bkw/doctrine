There are currently two different methods to install Doctrine.

* SVN (subversion)
* SVN externals

It is recommended to download Doctrine via SVN (subversion), because in this case updating is easy.
If your project is already under version control with SVN, you should choose SVN externals.


+++ SVN 

The installation of doctrine via SVN is very easy. Just get the latest revision of Doctrine from http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk.

In order to check out Doctrine in the current directory using the **svn** command line tool use the following code:

<code type="bash">
svn co http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk .
</code>

If you do not have a SVN client, chose one from the list below. Find the **Checkout** option and enter svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk in the **path** or **repository url** parameter. There is no need for a username or password to check out Doctrine. 

* [http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/ TortoiseSVN] a Windows application that  integrates into Windows Explorer
* [http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/development_tools/svnx.html svnx] a  Mac OS X GUI svn application 
* Eclipse has SVN integration through the [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ subeclipse] plugin

You can update to the latest version with

<code type="bash">
svn update
</code>

in your doctrine directory.


+++ SVN externals

If your project is under version control with SVN, you should set up doctrine via svn externals. You can do this with the **svn** command line tool:

<code type="bash"> 
svn pe svn:externals /path/to/project
</code>

You have to put the following line in the editor and save the changes.

<code>
doctrine http://svn.phpdoctrine.org/trunk
</code>

Afterwards you can download doctrine with

<code>
svn update
</code>
