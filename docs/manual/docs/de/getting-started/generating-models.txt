Doctrine offers the ability to generate models from existing databases, or from YAML schema files. You already read about 
generating models from an existing database in the [doc getting-started:working-with-existing-databases :index :name] 
section.
 
Here is a simple example of how to generate your models from YAML schema files.

Create a schema_files/user.yml and place the following yaml in the file
<code type="yaml">
---
User:
  columns:
    username: string(255)
    password: string(255)
</code>
Now we can use a little script to generate the Doctrine_Record definition.
<code type="php">
require_once('/path/to/Doctrine.php');
spl_autoload_register(array('Doctrine', 'autoload'));

Doctrine::generateModelsFromYaml('/path/to/schema_files/', '/path/to/generate/models');
</code>

Now you will have models/User.php and models/generated/BaseUser.php. User.php is for you to add custom code to, it is 
only generated once, and BaseUser.php is regenerated each time you call generateModelsFromYaml()
