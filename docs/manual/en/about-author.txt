[Jonathan](http://www.jwage.com ) is a software developer who resides in the 
rolling hills of Nashville, Tennessee. He joined the Doctrine project as a 
contributor in early 2007 and has been involved in one way or another since 
then. Jonathan currently works full-time as a software developer at 
**Sensio Labs**, a French web agency with 10 years of experience developing 
web applications.

It all began at the age of 12 when he first got his hands on the tools to build 
his first website. From then on he hopped from one thing to another learning 
the various aspects of programming in several different languages. He enjoys 
working on Doctrine as it is a daily challenge and allows him to explore 
uncharted territories in PHP.
