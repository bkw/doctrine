Lazy-connecting to database can save a lot of resources. There might be many pages where you don't need an actual 
database connection, hence its always recommended to use lazy-connecting (that means Doctrine will only connect to 
database when needed).

This feature can be very useful when using for example page caching, hence not actually needing a database connection 
on every request. Remember connecting to database is an expensive operation.

<code type="php">
// initalize a new Doctrine_Connection
$conn = Doctrine_Manager::connection('mysql://username:password@localhost/test');
// !! no actual database connection yet !!

// connects database and performs a query
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->execute();
