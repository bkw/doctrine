To know if your server supports the desirable PDO driver, you need to write a simple file with this content:

<code type="php">
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
</code>

Upload it to your server and execute this script.
You will notice a PDO box section scrolling down the page. Check if the driver you desire is active.

If your desired driver is not active, follow the [http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.installation.php PDO driver installation instruction] at PHP manual.
