Doctrine offers a way of setting column aliases. This can be very useful when you want to keep the application 
logic separate from the database logic. For example if you want to change the name of the database field all you 
need to change at your application is the column definition.

<code type="php">
class Book extends Doctrine_Record 
{
    public function setTableDefinition() 
    {
        $this->hasColumn('bookTitle as title', 'string');
    }
}

$book = new Book();
$book->title = 'Some book';
$book->save();
</code>

<code type="yaml">
---
Book:
  columns:
    name:
      name: bookTitle as title
      type: string
</code>
