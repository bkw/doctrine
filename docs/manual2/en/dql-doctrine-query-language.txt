++ Introduction

Doctrine Query Language (DQL) is an Object Query Language created for helping users in complex object retrieval. You should always consider using DQL (or raw SQL) when retrieving relational data efficiently (eg. when fetching users and their phonenumbers).

When compared to using raw SQL, DQL has several benefits: 
    
* From the start it has been designed to retrieve records(objects) not result set rows
* DQL understands relations so you don't have to type manually sql joins and join conditions
* DQL is portable on different databases
* DQL has some very complex built-in algorithms like (the record limit algorithm) which can help developer to efficiently retrieve objects
* It supports some functions that can save time when dealing with one-to-many, many-to-many relational data with conditional fetching.

If the power of DQL isn't enough, you should consider using the rawSql API for object population.

You may already be familiar with the following syntax:

> **CAUTION**
> DO NOT USE THE FOLLOWING CODE. It uses many sql queries for object population.

<code type="php">
$users = Doctrine::getTable('User')->findAll();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name . ' has phonenumbers: ';

    foreach($user->Phonenumber as $phonenumber) {
        echo $phonenumber . ' ';
    }
}
</code>

> **TIP**
> Here is the same code but implemented more efficiently using only one SQL query for object population.

<code type="php">
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->leftJoin('u.Phonenumber p')
          ->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name . ' has phonenumbers: ';

    foreach($user->Phonenumber as $phonenumber) {
        echo $phonenumber . ' ';
    }
}
</code>

> **CAUTION**
> Using double quotes (") in DQL strings is discouraged. This is sensible in MySQL standard but in DQL it can be confused as an identifier. Instead it is recommended to use prepared statements for your values and it will be escaped properly.

++ SELECT queries

{{SELECT}} statement syntax:

<code type="sql">
SELECT
    [ALL | DISTINCT]
    <select_expr>, ...
    [FROM <components>
    [WHERE <where_condition>]
    [GROUP BY <groupby_expr>
      [ASC | DESC], ... ]
    [HAVING <where_condition>]
    [ORDER BY <orderby_expr>
      [ASC | DESC], ...]
    [LIMIT <row_count> OFFSET <offset>}]
</code>

The {{SELECT}} statement is used for the retrieval of data from one or more components.

* Each {{select_expr}} indicates a column or an aggregate function value that you want to retrieve. There must be at least one {{select_expr}} in every {{SELECT}} statement.

<code type="sql">
SELECT a.name, a.amount FROM Account a
</code>

* An asterisk can be used for selecting all columns from given component. Even when using an asterisk the executed sql queries never actually use it (Doctrine converts asterisk to appropriate column names, hence leading to better performance on some databases).

<code type="sql">
SELECT a.* FROM Account a
</code>

* {{FROM}} clause {{components}} indicates the component or components from which to retrieve records.

<code type="sql">
SELECT a.* FROM Account a

SELECT u.*, p.*, g.* FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber p LEFT JOIN u.Group g
</code>

* The {{WHERE}} clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions that the records must satisfy to be selected. {{where_condition}} is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected. The statement selects all rows if there is no {{WHERE}} clause.

<code type="sql">
SELECT a.* FROM Account a WHERE a.amount > 2000
</code>

* In the {{WHERE}} clause, you can use any of the functions and operators that DQL supports, except for aggregate (summary) functions
* The {{HAVING}} clause can be used for narrowing the results with aggregate functions

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.* FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber p HAVING COUNT(p.id) > 3
</code>

* The {{ORDER BY}} clause can be used for sorting the results

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.* FROM User u ORDER BY u.name
</code>

* The {{LIMIT}} and {{OFFSET}} clauses can be used for efficiently limiting the number of records to a given {{row_count}}

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.* FROM User u LIMIT 20
</code>

+++ DISTINCT keyword

+++ Aggregate values

Aggregate value {{SELECT}} syntax:

<code type="php">
// SELECT u.*, COUNT(p.id) num_posts FROM User u, u.Posts p WHERE u.id = 1 GROUP BY u.id

$query = Doctrine_Query::create();

$query->select('u.id, COUNT(p.id) num_posts')
      ->from('User u, u.Posts p')
      ->where('u.id = ?', 1)
      ->groupby('u.id');

$users = $query->execute();

echo $users->Posts[0]->num_posts . ' posts found';
</code>

++ UPDATE queries

{{UPDATE}} statement syntax:

<code type="sql">
UPDATE //component_name//
    SET //col_name1//=//expr1// [, //col_name2//=//expr2// ...]
    [WHERE //where_condition//]
    [ORDER BY ...]
    [LIMIT //record_count//]
</code>

* The {{UPDATE}} statement updates columns of existing records in {{component_name}} with new values and returns the number of affected records.
* The {{SET}} clause indicates which columns to modify and the values they should be given.
* The optional {{WHERE}} clause specifies the conditions that identify which records to update. Without {{WHERE}} clause, all records are updated.
* The optional {{ORDER BY}} clause specifies the order in which the records are being updated.
* The {{LIMIT}} clause places a limit on the number of records that can be updated. You can use {{LIMIT row_count}} to restrict the scope of the {{UPDATE}}. A {{LIMIT}} clause is a **rows-matched restriction** not a rows-changed restriction. The statement stops as soon as it has found {{record_count}} rows that satisfy the {{WHERE}} clause, whether or not they actually were changed.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->update('Account')
    ->set('amount', 'amount + ?', '200')
    ->where('id > 200');

$rows = $q->execute();
          
echo $rows; // the number of affected rows
</code>

++ DELETE queries

<code type="sql">
DELETE FROM <component_name>
    [WHERE <where_condition>]
    [ORDER BY ...]
    [LIMIT <record_count>]
</code>

* The {{DELETE}} statement deletes records from {{component_name}} and returns the number of records deleted.
* The optional {{WHERE}} clause specifies the conditions that identify which records to delete. Without {{WHERE}} clause, all records are deleted.
* If the {{ORDER BY}} clause is specified, the records are deleted in the order that is specified.
* The {{LIMIT}} clause places a limit on the number of rows that can be deleted. The statement will stop as soon as it has deleted {{record_count}} records.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->delete()
    ->from('Account a')
    ->where('a.id > ?', 3);

$rows = $q->execute();

echo $rows; // the number of affected rows
</code>

++ FROM clause

Syntax:

<code type="sql">
FROM <component_reference> [[LEFT | INNER] JOIN <component_reference>] ...
</code>

The {{FROM}} clause indicates the component or components from which to retrieve records. If you name more than one component, you are performing a join. For each table specified, you can optionally specify an alias.

Consider the following DQL query:

<code type="sql">
FROM User u
</code>

Here 'User' is the name of the class (component) and 'u' is the alias. You should always use short aliases, since most of the time those make the query much shorther and also because when using for example caching the cached form of the query takes less space when short aliases are being used. 

The following example shows how to fetch all records from class 'User'.

<code type="php">
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
         ->from('User u')
         ->execute();
</code>

++ JOIN syntax

DQL JOIN Syntax:

<code>
[[LEFT | INNER] JOIN <component_reference1>] [ON | WITH] <join_condition1> [INDEXBY] <map_condition1>,
[[LEFT | INNER] JOIN <component_reference2>] [ON | WITH] <join_condition2> [INDEXBY] <map_condition2>,
...
[[LEFT | INNER] JOIN <component_referenceN>] [ON | WITH] <join_conditionN> [INDEXBY] <map_conditionN>
</code>

DQL supports two kinds of joins INNER JOINs and LEFT JOINs. For each joined component, you can optionally specify an alias.

* The default join type is {{LEFT JOIN}}. This join can be indicated by the use of either {{LEFT JOIN}} clause or simply '{{,}}', hence the following queries are equal:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.*, p.* FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber

SELECT u.*, p.* FROM User u, u.Phonenumber p
</code>

The recommended form is the first one.

* {{INNER JOIN}} produces an intersection between two specified components (that is, each and every record in the first component is joined to each and every record in the second component). So basically {{INNER JOIN}} can be used when you want to efficiently fetch for example all users which have one or more phonenumbers.

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.*, p.* FROM User u INNER JOIN u.Phonenumber p
</code>

By default DQL auto-adds the primary key join condition, so for DQL query:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id, p.id FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber
</code>

Would have a SQL equivalent:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id AS u__id, p.id AS p__id FROM User u LEFT JOIN Phonenumber p ON u.id = p.user_id
</code>

+++ ON keyword

If you want to override this behavior and add your own custom join condition you can do it with the {{ON}} keyword. Consider the following DQL query:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id, p.id FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber ON u.id = 2
</code>

This query would be converted into SQL:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id AS u__id, p.id AS p__id FROM User u LEFT JOIN Phonenumber p ON u.id = 2
</code>

+++ WITH keyword

Most of the time you don't need to override the primary join condition, rather you may want to add some custom conditions. This can be achieved with the {{WITH}} keyword.

DQL:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id, p.id FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber WITH u.id = 2
</code>

SQL:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id AS u__id, p.id AS p__id FROM User u LEFT JOIN Phonenumber p ON u.id = p.user_id AND u.id = 2
</code>


The Doctrine_Query API offers two convenience methods for adding JOINS. These are called innerJoin() and leftJoin(), which usage should be quite intuitive as shown below:

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();
$q->from('User u')
  ->leftJoin('u.Group g')
  ->innerJoin('u.Phonenumber p WITH u.id > 3')
  ->leftJoin('u.Email e');

$users = $q->execute();
</code>

++ INDEXBY keyword

The INDEXBY keyword offers a way of mapping certain columns as collection / array keys. By default Doctrine indexes multiple elements to numerically indexed arrays / collections. The mapping starts from zero. In order to override this behavior you need to use INDEXBY keyword as shown above:

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();
$q->from('User u INDEXBY u.name');

$users = $q->execute();
</code>

Now the users in $users collection are accessible through their names.

<code type="php">
echo $user['jack daniels']->id;
</code>

The INDEXBY keyword can be applied to any given JOIN. This means that any given component can have each own indexing behavior. In the following we use distinct indexing for both Users and Groups.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();
$q->from('User u INDEXBY u.name')->innerJoin('u.Group g INDEXBY g.name');

$users = $q->execute();
</code>

Now lets print out the drinkers club's creation date. 

<code type="php">
echo $users['jack daniels']->Group['drinkers club']->createdAt;
</code>

++ WHERE clause

Syntax:

<code type="sql">
WHERE <where_condition>
</code>

* The {{WHERE}} clause, if given, indicates the condition or conditions that the records must satisfy to be selected.
* {{where_condition}} is an expression that evaluates to true for each row to be selected.
* The statement selects all rows if there is no {{WHERE}} clause.
* When narrowing results with aggregate function values {{HAVING}} clause should be used instead of {{WHERE}} clause

++ Conditional expressions

+++ Literals

**Strings**

A string literal is enclosed in single quotes; for example: 'literal'. A string literal that includes a single quote is represented by two single quotes; for example: 'literal''s'.

<code type="sql">
FROM User WHERE User.name = 'Vincent'
</code>

**Integers**

Integer literals support the use of PHP integer literal syntax.

<code type="sql">
FROM User WHERE User.id = 4
</code>

**Floats**

Float literals support the use of PHP float literal syntax.

<code type="sql">
FROM Account WHERE Account.amount = 432.123
</code>

**Booleans**

The boolean literals are true and false.

<code type="sql">
FROM User WHERE User.admin = true

FROM Session WHERE Session.is_authed = false
</code>

**Enums**

The enumerated values work in the same way as string literals.

<code type="sql">
FROM User WHERE User.type = 'admin'
</code>

Predefined reserved literals are case insensitive, although its a good standard to write them in uppercase.

+++ Input parameters

<code type="php">
// POSITIONAL PARAMETERS:
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.name = ?', array('Arnold'))
          ->execute();

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.id > ? AND u.name LIKE ?', array(50, 'A%'))
          ->execute();

// NAMED PARAMETERS:

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.name = :name', array(':name' => 'Arnold'))
          ->execute();

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.id > :id AND u.name LIKE :name', array(':id' => 50, ':name' => 'A%'))
          ->execute();
</code>


+++ Operators and operator precedence

The operators are listed below in order of decreasing precedence.

||~ Operator ||~ Description        ||
|| .         || Navigation operator ||
||           || //Arithmetic operators: // ||
|| +, -      || unary               ||
|| *, /      || multiplication and division || 
|| +, -      || addition and subtraction    || 
|| =, >, >=, <, <=, <> (not equal), || Comparison operators ||
|| [NOT] LIKE, [NOT] IN, IS [NOT] NULL, IS [NOT] EMPTY || ||
||           || //Logical operators: // ||
|| NOT       || || 
|| AND       || || 
|| OR        || ||


+++ Between expressions

+++ In expressions

Syntax:

<code>
<operand> IN (<subquery>|<value list>)
</code>

An IN conditional expression returns true if the //operand// is found from result of the //subquery// or if its in the specificied comma separated //value list//, hence the IN expression is always false if the result of the subquery is empty.

When //value list// is being used there must be at least one element in that list.

<code type="sql">
FROM C1 WHERE C1.col1 IN (FROM C2(col1));

FROM User WHERE User.id IN (1,3,4,5)
</code>

The keyword IN is an alias for = ANY. Thus, these two statements are equal:

<code type="sql">
FROM C1 WHERE C1.col1 = ANY (FROM C2(col1));
FROM C1 WHERE C1.col1 IN    (FROM C2(col1));
</code>

+++ Like Expressions

Syntax:

<code>
string_expression [NOT] LIKE pattern_value [ESCAPE escape_character]
</code>

The string_expression must have a string value. The pattern_value is a string literal or a string-valued input parameter in which an underscore (_) stands for any single character, a percent (%) character stands for any sequence of characters (including the empty sequence), and all other characters stand for themselves. The optional escape_character is a single-character string literal or a character-valued input parameter (i.e., char or Character) and is used to escape the special meaning of the underscore and percent characters in pattern_value.

Examples:

* address.phone LIKE '12%3' is true for '123' '12993' and false for '1234'
* asentence.word LIKE 'l_se' is true for 'lose' and false for 'loose'
* aword.underscored LIKE '\_%' ESCAPE '\' is true for '_foo' and false for 'bar'
* address.phone NOT LIKE '12%3' is false for '123' and '12993' and true for '1234'

If the value of the string_expression or pattern_value is NULL or unknown, the value of the LIKE expression is unknown. If the escape_characteris specified and is NULL, the value of the LIKE expression is unknown.

<code type="php">
// finding all users whose email ends with '@gmail.com'
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->leftJoin('u.Email e')
          ->where('e.address LIKE ?', '%@gmail.com')
          ->execute();

// finding all users whose name starts with letter 'A'
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.name LIKE ?', 'A%')
          ->execute();
</code>

+++ Exists Expressions

Syntax:

<code>
<operand> [NOT ]EXISTS (<subquery>)
</code>

The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more rows and FALSE otherwise. 

The NOT EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns 0 rows and FALSE otherwise.

Finding all articles which have readers:

<code type="sql">
FROM Article a
  WHERE EXISTS (SELECT r.id FROM ReaderLog r
                WHERE r.article_id = a.id)
</code>

Finding all articles which don't have readers:

<code type="sql">
FROM Article a
  WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT r.id FROM ReaderLog r
                WHERE r.article_id = a.id)
</code>     

+++ All and Any Expressions

Syntax:

<code>
operand comparison_operator ANY (subquery)
operand comparison_operator SOME (subquery)
operand comparison_operator ALL (subquery)
</code>

An ALL conditional expression returns true if the comparison operation is true for all values in the result of the subquery or the result of the subquery is empty. An ALL conditional expression is false if the result of the comparison is false for at least one row, and is unknown if neither true nor false.

<code type="sql">
FROM C WHERE C.col1 < ALL (FROM C2(col1))
</code>

An ANY conditional expression returns true if the comparison operation is true for some value in the result of the subquery. An ANY conditional expression is false if the result of the subquery is empty or if the comparison operation is false for every value in the result of the subquery, and is unknown if neither true nor false. 

<code type="sql">
FROM C WHERE C.col1 > ANY (FROM C2(col1))
</code>

The keyword SOME is an alias for ANY.
 
<code type="sql">
FROM C WHERE C.col1 > SOME (FROM C2(col1))
</code>

The comparison operators that can be used with ALL or ANY conditional expressions are =, <, <=, >, >=, <>. The result of the subquery must be same type with the conditional expression.

NOT IN is an alias for <> ALL. Thus, these two statements are equal:

<code type="sql">
FROM C WHERE C.col1 <> ALL (FROM C2(col1));
FROM C WHERE C.col1 NOT IN (FROM C2(col1));
</code>

+++ Subqueries

A subquery can contain any of the keywords or clauses that an ordinary SELECT query can contain.

Some advantages of the subqueries:

* They allow queries that are structured so that it is possible to isolate each part of a statement.
* They provide alternative ways to perform operations that would otherwise require complex joins and unions.
* They are, in many people's opinion, readable. Indeed, it was the innovation of subqueries that gave people the original idea of calling the early SQL "Structured Query Language."

<code type="php">
// finding all users which don't belong to any group 1
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.id NOT IN (SELECT u.id FROM User u INNER JOIN u.Group g WHERE g.id = ?)')
          ->execute();

// finding all users which don't belong to any groups
// Notice: 
// the usage of INNER JOIN
// the usage of empty brackets preceding the Group component

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.id NOT IN (SELECT u.id FROM User u INNER JOIN u.Group g)')
          ->execute();
</code>

++ Functional Expressions

+++ String functions

* The //CONCAT// function returns a string that is a concatenation of its arguments. In the example above we map the concatenation of users firstname and lastname to a value called name

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();

$users = $q->select('CONCAT(u.firstname, u.lastname) name')->from('User u')->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    // here 'name' is not a property of $user,
    // its a mapped function value
    echo $user->name;
}
</code>

* The second and third arguments of the //SUBSTRING// function denote the starting position and length of the substring to be returned. These arguments are integers. The first position of a string is denoted by 1. The //SUBSTRING// function returns a string.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();

$users = $q->select('u.name')->from('User u')->where("SUBSTRING(u.name, 0, 1) = 'z'")->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name;
}
</code>

* The //TRIM// function trims the specified character from a string. If the character to be trimmed is not specified, it is assumed to be space (or blank). The optional trim_character is a single-character string literal or a character-valued input parameter (i.e., char or Character)[30]. If a trim specification is not provided, BOTH is assumed. The //TRIM// function returns the trimmed string.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->select('u.name')-
    >from('User u')
    ->where('TRIM(u.name) = ?', 'Someone');

$users = $q->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name;
}
</code>    

* The //LOWER// and //UPPER// functions convert a string to lower and upper case, respectively. They return a string. 

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();

$users = $q->select('u.name')->from('User u')->where("LOWER(u.name) = 'someone'")->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name;
}
</code>  

* The //LOCATE// function returns the position of a given string within a string, starting the search at a specified position. It returns the first position at which the string was found as an integer. The first argument is the string to be located; the second argument is the string to be searched; the optional third argument is an integer that represents the string position at which the search is started (by default, the beginning of the string to be searched). The first position in a string is denoted by 1. If the string is not found, 0 is returned.
* The //LENGTH// function returns the length of the string in characters as an integer.

+++ Arithmetic functions

Availible DQL arithmetic functions:

<code>
ABS(simple_arithmetic_expression)
SQRT(simple_arithmetic_expression)
MOD(simple_arithmetic_expression, simple_arithmetic_expression)
</code>

* The //ABS// function returns the absolute value for given number. 
* The //SQRT// function returns the square root for given number. 
* The //MOD// function returns the modulus of first argument using the second argument.

++ Subqueries

+++ Introduction

Doctrine allows you to use sub-dql queries in the FROM, SELECT and WHERE statements. Below you will find examples for all the different types of subqueries Doctrine supports.

+++ Comparisons using subqueries

Find all the users which are not in a specific group.

<code type="php">
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->from('User u')
          ->where('u.id NOT IN (SELECT u.id FROM User u INNER JOIN u.Group g WHERE g.id = ?)')
          ->execute(1);
</code>

Retrieve the users phonenumber in a subquery and include it in the resultset of user information.

<code type="php">
$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->select('u.*, (SELECT p.phonenumber FROM Phonenumber p WHERE p.user_id = u.id LIMIT 1) as phonenumber')
          ->from('User u')
          ->execute();
</code>

++ GROUP BY, HAVING clauses

DQL GROUP BY syntax:

<code>
GROUP BY groupby_item {, groupby_item}*
</code>

DQL HAVING syntax:

<code>
HAVING conditional_expression
</code> 

* GROUP BY and HAVING clauses can be used for dealing with aggregate functions
* Following aggregate functions are available on DQL: COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM

Selecting alphabetically first user by name.

<code type="sql">
SELECT MIN(u.name) FROM User u
</code>

Selecting the sum of all Account amounts.

<code type="sql">
SELECT SUM(a.amount) FROM Account a
</code>

* Using an aggregate function in a statement containing no GROUP BY clause, results in grouping on all rows. In the example above we fetch all users and the number of phonenumbers they have.

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.*, COUNT(p.id) FROM User u, u.Phonenumber p GROUP BY u.id
</code>

* The HAVING clause can be used for narrowing the results using aggregate values. In the following example we fetch all users which have atleast 2 phonenumbers

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.* FROM User u, u.Phonenumber p HAVING COUNT(p.id) >= 2
</code>

<code type="php">
// retrieve all users and the phonenumber count for each user

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->select('u.*, COUNT(p.id) count')
          ->from('User u')
          ->leftJoin('u.Phonenumber p')
          ->groupBy('u.id')
          ->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo $user->name . ' has ' . $user->Phonenumber[0]->count . ' phonenumbers';
}
</code>

++ ORDER BY clause

+++ Introduction

Record collections can be sorted efficiently at the database level using the ORDER BY clause.

Syntax:

<code>
[ORDER BY {ComponentAlias.columnName}
[ASC | DESC], ...]
</code>

Examples:

<code type="sql">
FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber p
  ORDER BY u.name, p.phonenumber

FROM User u, u.Email e
  ORDER BY e.address, u.id
</code>

In order to sort in reverse order you can add the DESC (descending) keyword to the name of the column in the ORDER BY clause that you are sorting by. The default is ascending order; this can be specified explicitly using the ASC keyword. 

<code type="sql">
FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Email e
  ORDER BY e.address DESC, u.id ASC;
</code>

+++ Sorting by an aggregate value

In the following example we fetch all users and sort those users by the number of phonenumbers they have.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();

$users = $q->select('u.*, COUNT(p.id) count')
           ->from('User u')
           ->innerJoin('u.Phonenumber p')
           ->orderby('count');
</code>

+++ Using random order

In the following example we use random in the ORDER BY clause in order to fetch random post.

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create();

$posts = $q->select('p.*, RANDOM() rand')
           ->from('Post p')
           ->orderby('rand')
           ->limit(1)
           ->execute();

$randomPost = $posts[0];

++ LIMIT and OFFSET clauses

Propably the most complex feature DQL parser has to offer is its LIMIT clause parser. Not only does the DQL LIMIT clause parser take care of LIMIT database portability it is capable of limiting the number of records instead of rows by using complex query analysis and subqueries.

<code type="php">
// retrieve the first 20 users and all their associated phonenumbers

$users = Doctrine_Query::create()
          ->select('u.*, p.*')
          ->from('User u')
          ->leftJoin('u.Phonenumber p')
          ->limit(20)
          ->execute();

foreach($users as $user) {
    echo ' --- '.$user->name.' --- \n';

    foreach($user->Phonenumber as $p) {
        echo $p->phonenumber.'\n';
    }
}
</code>

+++ Driver Portability

DQL LIMIT clause is portable on all supported databases. Special attention have been paid to following facts:

* Only Mysql, Pgsql and Sqlite implement LIMIT / OFFSET clauses natively
* In Oracle / Mssql / Firebird LIMIT / OFFSET clauses need to be emulated in driver specific way
* The limit-subquery-algorithm needs to execute to subquery separately in mysql, since mysql doesn't yet support LIMIT clause in subqueries
* Pgsql needs the order by fields to be preserved in SELECT clause, hence limit-subquery-algorithm needs to take this into consideration when pgsql driver is used
* Oracle only allows < 30 object identifiers (= table/column names/aliases), hence the limit subquery must use as short aliases as possible and it must avoid alias collisions with the main query.

+++ The limit-subquery-algorithm

The limit-subquery-algorithm is an algorithm that DQL parser uses internally when one-to-many / many-to-many relational data is being fetched simultaneously. This kind of special algorithm is needed for the LIMIT clause to limit the number of records instead of sql result set rows.

This behavior can be overwritten using the configuration system (at global, connection or table level) using:

<code type="php">
$table->setAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_QUERY_LIMIT, Doctrine::LIMIT_ROWS);
$table->setAttribute(Doctrine::ATTR_QUERY_LIMIT, Doctrine::LIMIT_RECORDS); // revert
</code>

In the following example we have users and phonenumbers with their relation being one-to-many. Now lets say we want fetch the first 20 users and all their related phonenumbers.

Now one might consider that adding a simple driver specific LIMIT 20 at the end of query would return the correct results. Thats wrong, since we you might get anything between 1-20 users as the first user might have 20 phonenumbers and then record set would consist of 20 rows.

DQL overcomes this problem with subqueries and with complex but efficient subquery analysis. In the next example we are going to fetch first 20 users and all their phonenumbers with single efficient query. Notice how the DQL parser is smart enough to use column aggregation inheritance even in the subquery and how it's smart enough to use different aliases for the tables in the subquery to avoid alias collisions.

DQL QUERY:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id, u.name, p.* FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber p LIMIT 20
</code>

SQL QUERY:
 
<code type="sql">
SELECT
    e.id AS e__id,
    e.name AS e__name,
    p.id AS p__id,
    p.phonenumber AS p__phonenumber,
    p.entity_id AS p__entity_id
FROM entity e
LEFT JOIN phonenumber p ON e.id = p.entity_id
WHERE e.id IN (
SELECT DISTINCT e2.id
FROM entity e2
WHERE (e2.type = 0) LIMIT 20) AND (e.type = 0)
</code>

In the next example we are going to fetch first 20 users and all their phonenumbers and only those users that actually have phonenumbers with single efficient query, hence we use an INNER JOIN. Notice how the DQL parser is smart enough to use the INNER JOIN in the subquery.

DQL QUERY:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id, u.name, p.* FROM User u LEFT JOIN u.Phonenumber p LIMIT 20
</code>

SQL QUERY:
 
<code type="sql">
SELECT 
    e.id AS e__id,
    e.name AS e__name,
    p.id AS p__id,
    p.phonenumber AS p__phonenumber,
    p.entity_id AS p__entity_id
FROM entity e
LEFT JOIN phonenumber p ON e.id = p.entity_id
WHERE e.id IN (
SELECT DISTINCT e2.id
FROM entity e2
INNER JOIN phonenumber p2 ON e2.id = p2.entity_id
WHERE (e2.type = 0) LIMIT 20) AND (e.type = 0)
</code>

++ Named Queries

When you are dealing with a model that may change, but you need to keep your queries easily updated, you need to find an easy way to define queries. Imagine for example that you change one field and you need to follow all queries in your application to make sure it'll not break anything.

Named Queries is a nice and effective way to solve this situation, allowing you to create Doctrine_Queries and reuse them without the need to keep rewritting them.

The Named Query support is built at the top of Doctrine_Query_Registry support. Doctrine_Query_Registry is a class for registering and naming queries. It helps with the organization of your applications queries and along with that it offers some very nice convenience stuff.

The queries are added using the add() method of the registry object. It takes two parameters, the query name and the actual DQL query.

<code type="php">
$r = Doctrine_Manager::getInstance()->getQueryRegistry();

$r->add('User/all', 'FROM User u');

$userTable = Doctrine::getTable('User');

// find all users
$users = $userTable->find('all');
</code>

To simplify this support, Doctrine_Table support some accessors to Doctrine_Query_Registry.

+++ Creating a Named Query

When you build your models with option generateTableClasses defined as true, each record class will also generate a *Table class, extending from Doctrine_Table.

Then, you can implement the method construct() to include your Named Queries:

<code type="php">
class MyFooTable extends Doctrine_Table
{
    public function construct()
    {
        // Named Query defined using DQL string
        $this->addNamedQuery('get.by.id', 'SELECT f.* FROM MyFoo f WHERE f.id = ?');

        // Named Query defined using Doctrine_Query object
        $this->addNamedQuery(
            'get.by.similar.names', Doctrine_Query::create()
                ->select('f.id, f.value0')
                ->from('MyFoo f')
                ->where('LOWER(f.name) LIKE LOWER(?)')
        );
    }
}
</code>

+++ Accessing Named Query

To reach the MyFooTable class, which is a subclass of Doctrine_Table, you can do the following:

<code type="php">
$MyFooTableInstance = Doctrine::getTable('MyFoo');
</code>

To access the Named Query (will return you a Doctrine_Query instance, always):

<code type="php">
$query = $MyFooTableInstance->createNamedQuery('get.by.id');
</code>

+++ Executing a Named Query

There are two ways to execute a Named Query. The first one is by retrieving the Doctrine_Query and then executing it normally, as a normal instance:

<code type="php">
$fooItems = Doctrine::getTable('MyFoo')
    ->createNamedQuery('get.by.similar.names')
    ->execute(array('%jon%wage%'));
</code>

You can also simplify the execution, by doing:

<code type="php">
$fooItems = Doctrine::getTable('MyFoo')
    ->find('get.by.similar.names', array('%jon%wage%'));
</code>

The method find() also accepts a third parameter, which is the hydration mode.

+++ Cross-Acessing Named Query

If that's not enough, Doctrine take advantage the Doctrine_Query_Registry and uses namespaced queries to enable cross-access of Named Queries between objects. Suppose you have the *Table class instance of record "MyBar". You want to call the "get.by.id" Named Query of record "MyFoo". To acess the Named Query, you have to do:

<code type="php">
$MyBarTable = Doctrine::getTable('MyBar');

// ...

$MyFooItems = $MyBarTable->find('MyFoo/get.by.id', array(1, 2, 3), Doctrine::HYDRATE_RECORD);

// MyFooItems is a Doctrine_Collection, with MyFoo records (Doctrine_Record).

++ Magic Finders

Doctrine offers some magic finders for your Doctrine models that allow you to find a record by any column that is present in the model. This is helpful for simply finding a user by their username, or finding a group by the name of it. Normally this would require writing a Doctrine_Query instance and storing this somewhere so it can be reused. That is no longer needed for simple situations like that.

The basic pattern for the finder methods are as follows: findBy%s($value) or findOneBy%s($value). The %s can be a column name or a relation alias. If you give a column name you must give the value you are looking for. If you specify a relationship alias, you can either pass an instance of the relation class to find, or give the actual primary key value.

Examples:
<code type="php">
// The normal find by primary key method
$userTable = Doctrine::getTable('User');

$user = $userTable->find(1);

// Find one user by the username
$userTable = Doctrine::getTable('User');

$user = $userTable->findOneByUsername('jonwage');

// Find phonenumbers for the user above
$phoneTable = Doctrine::getTable('Phonenumber');

$phonenumbers = $phoneTable->findByUser($user);
</code>

++ Debugging Queries

The {{Doctrine_Query}} object has a few functions that can be used to help debug problems with the query:

Sometimes you may want to see the complete DQL string of your {{Doctrine_Query}} object:

<code type="php">
$q = Doctrine_Query::create()
    ->from('User u')
    ->orderBy('u.username');

echo $q->getDql();
</code>

This would output the following DQL:

<code type="sql">
FROM User u ORDER BY u.name
</code>

Or you may want to get the execute the DQL parsing process and get the SQL that would be sent to PDO:

<code type="php">
echo $q->getSql();
</code>

This would output the following SQL:

<code type="sql">
SELECT u.id AS u__id, u.name as u__name FROM user u ORDER BY u__name
</code?>

> **NOTE**
> The SQL returned above by the {{Doctrine_Query::getSql()}} function does not replace the tokens with the parameters. This is the job of PDO and when we execute the query we pass the parameters to PDO where the replacement is executed. You can retrieve the array of parameters with the {{Doctrine_Query::getParams()}} method.

Get the array of parameters for the {{Doctrine_Query}} instance:

<code type="php">
print_r($q->getParams());
</code>
