In real world applications, display content from database tables is a commom task. Also, imagine that this content is a search result containing thousands of items. Undoubtely, it will be a huge listing, memory expensive and hard for users to find the right item. That is where some organization of this content display is needed and pagination comes in rescue.

Doctrine implements a highly flexible pager package, allowing you to not only split listing in pages, but also enabling you to control the layout of page links. 
In this chapter, we'll learn how to create pager objects, control pager styles and at the end, overview the pager layout object - a powerful page links displayer of Doctrine.
