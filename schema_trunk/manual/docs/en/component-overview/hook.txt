+++ Introduction

Many web applications have different kinds of lists. The lists may contain data from multiple components (= database tables) and they may have actions such as paging, sorting and setting conditions. {{Doctrine_Hook}} helps building these lists. It has a simple API for building search criteria forms as well as building a DQL query from the 'hooked' parameters.
