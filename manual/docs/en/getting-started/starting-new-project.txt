Doctrine_Record is the basic component of every doctrine-based project. There should be atleast one Doctrine_Record for 
each of your database tables. Doctrine_Record follows the [http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html 
Active Record pattern]

Doctrine always adds a primary key column named 'id' to tables that doesn't have any primary keys specified. Only thing 
you need to for creating database tables is defining a class which extends Doctrine_Record and setting a setTableDefinition 
method with hasColumn() method calls and by exporting those classes.

Lets say we want to create a database table called 'user' with columns id(primary key), name, username, password and 
created. Provided that you have already installed Doctrine these few lines of code are all you need:

User.php :
<code type="php">
class User extends Doctrine_Record 
{
    public function setTableDefinition() 
    {
        // set 'user' table columns, note that
        // id column is auto-created as no primary key is specified
        
        $this->hasColumn('name', 'string',30);
        $this->hasColumn('username', 'string',20);
        $this->hasColumn('password', 'string',16);
    }
    
    public function setUp()
    {
        $this->actAs('Timestampable');
    }
}
</code>

You can alternatively specify your Doctrine schema information as a YAML schema file. Below is an example user.yml file 
which you can generate your Doctrine_Record from.

<code type="yml">
---
User:
  actAs: [Timestampable]
  columns:
    name: string(30)
    username: string(20)
    password: string(16)
</code>

You can generate the php code from the yaml with the following code.

<code type="php">
Doctrine::generateModelsFromYaml('/path/to/user.yml', '/path/to/generate/models);
</code>

Have a look in /path/to/generate/models/ and /path/to/generate/models/generated. You will see User.php and BaseUser.php.
User.php is for you to add your own custom functionality, and BaseUser.php is the code which is automatically regenerated 
from the YAML schema file above each time.

Now that we have a Doctrine_Record class, we can export it to the database and create the tables. For exporting the user 
class into database we need a simple build script:

<code type="php">
//require the base Doctrine class
require_once('path-to-doctrine/lib/Doctrine.php');

//register the autoloader
spl_autoload_register(array('Doctrine', 'autoload'));

require_once('User.php');

//set up a connection
Doctrine_Manager::connection('mysql://user:pass@localhost/test');

//export the classes
Doctrine::createTablesFromArray(array('User'));
</code>
We now have a user model that supports basic CRUD opperations!
