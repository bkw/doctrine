++ Requirements
Doctrine requires PHP >= 5.2.3+. it doesn't require any external libraries. For database function call abstraction 
Doctrine uses PDO which comes bundled with the PHP official release that you get from www.php.net. If you use a 3 
in 1 package under windows like Uniform Server or any other non official package, you may be required to perform 
additional configurations.
